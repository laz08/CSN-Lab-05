# Introduction

In this delivery we are asked to simulate three network growth models and study them from a statistical perspective. 

The first one is the original Barabasi Albert model, and the other two are based on this one with some variations:

1. BA: growth & preferential attachment
2. BA': growth & random attachment
3. BA'': No growth & preferential attachment

We are going to discuss the results and the methods used, as well as cover the implementation done and problems encountered.


# Results

```{r echo=FALSE}
plotAllEvolutions(table.BA)
plotAllEvolutions(table.BA.Rand)
plotAllEvolutions(table.BA.no.growth)
```
